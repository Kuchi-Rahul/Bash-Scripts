# 🚀 Daily Bash Scripts

This repository is a personal log of my journey in improving Bash scripting skills through daily practice.  
The focus is on writing, testing, and refining scripts that solve practical problems or demonstrate Bash concepts.  



## 🌈 Why Daily Bash? 

Consistent practice is the fastest way to get comfortable with Bash.  
This repo is where I experiment, learn, and record progress through small, daily steps.  
Here’s what to expect:  

- **Daily Scripts**: New or updated scripts added regularly.  
- **Range of Topics**: From quick one-liners to more complete automation scripts.  
- **Learning Notes**: Short takeaways on what worked, what didn’t, and lessons learned.  
- **Readable Code**: Clear comments and structure to make scripts easy to understand and adapt.  

Pro Tip: Bash isn't just for sysadmins—it's for anyone who loves efficiency!  



## 📂 Repo Structure
My development setup runs on an **ASUS machine** inside a **MinGW64 environment**.  

Here’s how things are organized:  

- **Parent Directory**: `/c/Git` holds multiple projects, including `Calculator`, `crop-recommendation-project`, `Linux-Playbook`, and `Git`.  
- **This Repository**: `/c/Git/Bash-Scripts/scripts-v1` is dedicated to Bash scripting practice, tracked on the `main` branch.  
- **Git Identity**: All commits are authored under the name **Rahul** (`git config user.name Rahul`).  

All scripts are version-controlled with Git, and I’m proud to commit as **Rahul** (`git config user.name Rahul`). Want to see the magic? Clone the repo and explore!



## 🛠️ How to Run These Scripts  

1. **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/Kuchi-Rahul/Bash-Scripts.git`
2. **Navigate**: `cd Bash-Scripts/scripts-v1`
3. **Make Executable**: `chmod +x script_name.sh`
4. **Run It**: `./script_name.sh`

Dependencies? Most are pure bash, but some might need tools like `curl` or `jq`. I'll note 'em in the script comments.
